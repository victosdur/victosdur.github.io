This repository contains implementations of various games modeled through Markov Decision Processes (MDP). Each game includes both a graphical representation of the MDP and its optimal solution calculated using Value Iteration. Additionally, a detailed description of the resulting optimal policies is provided.Check out
the full code in my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/victosdur/SVRAI.git).
