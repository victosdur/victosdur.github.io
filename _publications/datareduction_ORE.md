title: "An in-depth analysis of data reduction methods for sustainable deep learning"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/datareduction_ORE
excerpt: 'In this paper, we present up to eight different methods to reduce the size of a tabular training dataset, and we develop a Python package to apply them. We also introduce a representativeness metric based on topology to measure the similarity between the reduced datasets and the full training dataset. Additionally, we develop a methodology to apply these data reduction methods to image datasets for object detection tasks.'
