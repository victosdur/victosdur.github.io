excerpt: 'In this paper, we provide a result guaranteeing that if two datasets are related by epsilon-representativeness, i.e., both of them have points closer than  epsilon, then the predictions by the classic decision tree are similar. Experimentally, we have also tested that epsilon-representativeness presents a significant correlation with the ordering of the feature importance.'
