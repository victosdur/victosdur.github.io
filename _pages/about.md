<h2> My story </h2>

<p>

I'm Victor Toscano Dur√°n, an Artificial Intelligence researcher, and PhD Student at the University of Seville in the Applied Mathematics I, and part of <a href="https://grupo.us.es/cimagroup/">CIMAgroup</a> research team. Previously, I completed my Bachelor's Degree in Statistics at the University of Seville in 2022. Later, I obtained a Master's Degree in Logic, Computation, and Artificial Intelligence in 2023, also at the University of Seville. The PhD is being carried out under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://personal.us.es/rogodi/index.htm">Roc√≠o Gonz√°lez D√≠az</a>, <a href="https://www.cs.us.es/~naranjo/">Miguel √Ångel Guti√©rrez Naranjo</a>, and Dr. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matteo-rucco-15561a64/">Matteo Rucco</a>
</p>

<p>
During the final year of the bachelor, I started an intership as a data scientist at <a href="https://fisevi.com/">Andalusian Public Foundation for Health Research Management in Seville (FISEVI)</a>, where mainly I performed data analysis applying statistical techniques to clinical data, including the elaboration of reports for medical doctors. At the end of 2022, I briefly worked as a software developer at <a href="https://www.solera.com/">Solera</a> before joining <a href="https://www.glucube.com/">Glucube</a> (previously named as Igluco Tech), where I was responsible for developing AI models, as well as performing data analysis, for a non-invasive glucose monitoring device, which was successfully launched to the market while I was still part of the company. This change came about because I knew I wanted to focus mainly on artificial intelligence and data analysis.
</p>

<p>
Since December 2023, I am a pre-doctoral researcher in the Department of Applied Mathematics I at the <a href="https://www.us.es/">University of Seville</a>, contracted by the European project <a href="https://rexasi-pro.spindoxlabs.com/">REXASI-PRO</a>. My work on the project focuses on optimizing energy consumption in the detection of people and wheelchairs using the YOLO object detection and localization model, employing data reduction techniques. This, in collaboration with colleagues, achieved the preservation of model performance (such as YOLO for person and wheelchair detection), while using only 25% of the training data, resulting in substantial reductions in computation time, cost, and energy consumption. The results have been published on a <a href="https://open-research-europe.ec.europa.eu/articles/4-101">paper</a> in the Open Research Europe journal.Additionally, I contribute to improving the behavior of robot fleets through topological methods. Related to that, I visited Prof. Maurizio Mongelli and his team from the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR) in Genoa, Italy, during October 2024, where I explored the use of computational topology for predicting safe scenarios in robotic simulations using eXplainable Artificial Intelligence techniques, field in which Maurizio Mongelli is an expert. We got a paper accepted into <a href="https://xaiworldconference.com/2025/">XAI-2025</a>. 
</p>

<p>
Additionally, between April and June 2025 (6th April to 6th June), I visited <a href="https://bastian.rieck.me/">Prof. Dr. Bastian Rieck</a> and his lab, the <a href="https://aidos.group/">AIDOS Lab</a> based in the University of Fribourg, Switzerland. The main objective of this research stay was to use topological tools, such as the Euler Characteristic Transform, in the context of computational healthcare, more specifically in molecule learning tasks, and to find out more about what he was working on, with the aim of creating a fruitful collaboration for the future.
</p>

<p>
PhD main objective is about exploring how to effectively integrate TDA at different levels of the machine learning process, from feature extraction to the design and evaluation of machine learning techniques and especially neural networks.
</p>

<p>
In short, I consider myself as a passionate researcher and data scientist with such a nice academic background and experience in the fields of statistics, artificial intelligence, and mathematics. My focus goes beyond merely acquiring knowledge; I am committed to continuous learning and constant improvement, as AI gives no respite. Obviously, if you would like to collaborate or speak about these topics, feel free to email me. I am always happy to work with new people, as well as get to know new ideas.
</p>

<p>
In my free time, I used to practice sport, such as weighlifting and padel (I would like to do a bit of everything üòÄ), as well as getting lost in nature.

<!-- This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
